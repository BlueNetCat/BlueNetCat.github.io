# VISAP
## Information to visualize
### Pesca d'arrossegament (Trawling)
#### Catches Pie charts
Something like a [d3 pie chart](https://bluenetcataccio4.github.io/VISAP/piechart/) could be used.
##### Options available in the given report
These options will probably require new queries to the server/BBDD. For example, the aforementioned pie chart is divided in areas/harbours.
- Per area/harbour (Roses, l'Escala, Palam√≥s...)
- Per season (Autumn, Winter, Spring...)

##### Option Commercial/Rebuig/Restes (app: client-side checkboxes)
A checkbox that would hide the unselected catch type (Comercial, Rebuig, Restes). The piecharts would update themselves. This way, one could compare different harbours or seasons. This checkboxes could have more levels, so one could compare the human waste collected in different areas/seasons.

##### Option KG or Percentage (app: client-side switch)
In the given report, the values are only stated in percentage. It would be useful to report the values in KG. One could compare the cacthes in KG of different areas/sesons.

##### Other thoughts
This pie chart could be used when checking at individual sampling of trawling (mostreig) on the map.

#### Routes Map
A map where the routes of the fishing vessels could be checked, as in the given report.

##### Density (fishing effort, catches, economic performance)
As shown in the report. This could be served with a WMS from a GeoServer. We have to agree on the temporal resolution (and projection).

##### Individual sampled boats (mostreig)
As shown in the report. The routes could be served with a GeoJSON. Other info could pop up, like the date and a pie chart of the catches of that boat on that sampling day.

### Pesca d'encerclament
A [pie chart](https://bluenetcataccio4.github.io/VISAP/piechart/) is in development. Checklist of milestones:
- [x] Server
  - [x] Nodejs server with queries to the database and REST API for web client requests
  - [x] Backup method for providing (static) data if server and database are down
  - [ ] Automatically upload of static data to github's visualizer repository
  - [ ] Install in production server
  - [ ] Set up with a daemon
- [x] Basic pie chart visualization of biomass per port
  - [x] Preprocess data from server to be used in visualizer
  - [x] Discuss color palette (custom or as in report)
  - [x] Species with small biomass in "Altres" group
  - [ ] Add tab location in pie chart
  - [ ] Ability to select/deselect species (with a checklist?)
  - [ ] More info about each species when clicked?
  - [ ] Add fishing per stratum (requires new query from J. Ribera)
- [ ] Query for data organized per season (requires new query)

Regarding the map visualization, here is the checklist:
- [ ] Server
  - [ ] GeoServer for WMS
  - [ ] Nodejs for static files (csv-like)
- [ ] Map visualizer
  - [x] Openlayers WMS color filter with SVG
  - [ ] Tile cache client side
  - [ ] Visualize tracks of the hauls and clickon events
  - [ ] Pie charts of the samples collected by each haul when clicked
