# Guide to create Mapbox Vector Tiles
One of the issues of vector data contained in a static file (e.g. geojson) is that high resolution is not often recommended because the file will be large and heavy to visualize. Mapbox already addressed this issue and proposed the Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVT), which serves vector data in a similar way as Web Map Tile Service (WMTS). It is fast and lightweight.

It is possible to convert shapefiles or geojson to MVT and to provide the data to the client even without a server. In this document the steps to do so are described.

## Requirements
You need to work with Linux and install these packages:
- [tipppecanoe](https://github.com/mapbox/tippecanoe)
- [mbutil](https://github.com/mapbox/mbutil)

## Steps
### 1. Transform your data to geojson
### 2. Create a .mbtiles file with tippecanoe
```
tippecanoe -zg -o out.mbtiles --drop-densest-as-needed in.geojson
```
The .mbtiles file can be decompressed into .pbf files, which contain the final vector data but gzipped. The .mbtiles file is the recommended option if you want to have a service to provide MVTs.
### 3. Decompress the .mbtiles file with mb-util
```
mb-util --image_format=pbf out.mbtiles outDirectory
```
### 4. Unzip the .pbf files
```
gzip -d -r -S .pbf *
```
### 5. Add the .pbf extension (it was removed in the previous step)
```
find . -type f -exec mv '{}' '{}'.pbf \;
```

## Example with Openlayers
You should be able to visualize your MVT with this code
```
var map = new ol.Map({
        layers: [
          new ol.layer.VectorTile({
            declutter: true,
            source: new ol.source.VectorTile({
              attributions:
                'Â© <your attributions>',
              format: new ol.format.MVT(),
              url: 'outDirectory/{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf',
            }),
          }) ],
        target: 'my-html-container-id',
        view: new ol.View({
          center: [0, 0],
          zoom: 2,
        }),
      });
```
